Hostker Python SDK.

Translate from [ker.js](https://github.com/csvwolf/ker.js/blob/master/src/ker.js)

pip install ker
```

## Usage

from ker import Ker
ker = Ker([email], [token])
ker.test()
```

## Q&A

### No Test?
Yes, I have no enough data and services usages to test. Hostker don't has token or account for testing either. But the connection is ok by test api.

### Can I contribute?
Welcome, even if you just found a api is not working and report me with issues.
